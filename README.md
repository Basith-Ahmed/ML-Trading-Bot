# Machine Learning Bot with Technical Indicators and Logistic Regression

This README explains a machine learning bot designed to predict optimal times for buying and selling stocks, incorporating a variety of features for enhanced analysis.

**Target Audience:**

* Investors seeking insights from quantitative data analysis, including Bitcoin integration, technical indicators, and logistic regression-based predictions.
* Data scientists curious about the implementation of these features and logistic regression modeling for stock prediction.
* Financial professionals seeking AI-powered tools with these functionalities.

**Disclaimer:**

* This bot's predictions are based on statistical models and historical data, not financial advice. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Users are responsible for their own investment decisions and should conduct thorough research before taking any action.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Integration:** 
    * Financial markets
    * Economic indicators
    * Bitcoin blockchain data
    * Technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD, StochRSI)
* **Price Normalization:** For easier comparison across stocks and timeframes.
* **Local Maxima/Minima Exploration:**
    * Leverages existing algorithms for trend identification.
    * Explores numerical optimization techniques and statistical analysis.
* **Logistic Regression Modeling:**
    * Analyzes local maxima/minima and indicator values.
    * Predicts future price movements and suggests buying/selling opportunities.

**Data Preprocessing:**

* Identify local maxima/minima points with corresponding indicator values.
* Split extracted data into training and testing sets.

**Model Training:**

* Train logistic regression model on training data:
    * Input features: Indicator values at local maxima/minima.
    * Target variable: Future price movement (up/down).
* Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

**Model Evaluation:**

* Evaluate model on testing data:
    * Assess accuracy and generalization ability.
    * Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
